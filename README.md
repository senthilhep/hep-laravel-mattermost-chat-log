# Laravel/Lumen Mattermost Chat Log

Brings up the option for sending the logs to Mattermost chat from [Laravel](https://laravel.com)/[Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com).

## Installation
### Composer install
```shell
composer require senthilhep/hep-laravel-mattermost-chat-log
```

Add the following code to the channels array in `config/logging.php` in your laravel/lumen application.

```
In Laravel, error codes are categorized by levels:
Info = 200;
Notice = 250;
Warning = 300;
Error = 400;
Critical = 500;
Alert = 550;
Emergency = 600;
Errors reported with a level greater than the configured setting will be logged accordingly.
```
```
'mattermost-chat' => [
    'driver' => 'monolog',
    'url' => env('LOG_MATTERMOST_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL', ''),
    'error_level' => env('LOG_MATTERMOST_ERROR_LEVEL' , 400),
    'timezone' => env('LOG_MATTERMOST_CHAT_TIMEZONE' , 'Asia/Kolkata'),
    'handler' => \Enigma\MattermostChatHandler::class,
],
```

You can provide the eight logging levels defined in the [RFC 5424 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424): `emergency`, `alert`, `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, and `debug`

<b>Note*:</b> Make sure to set the <b>LOG_MATTERMOST_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL</b> env variable.

In order to notify different users for different log levels, you can set the corresponding env keys mentioned to configure in the `logging.php` file.
